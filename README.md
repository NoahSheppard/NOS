## NOS 
Just a very simple kernel (for now) that does basic stuff

Making this for shits and giggles (I want to learn kernel development)

Join me as I go crazy in git history with commit messages that will track my thoughts and moods

Suggestions and feedback highly appreacited - I am learning, so go as harsh as you want - the sooner I learn the right way, the better. 

Do what you want with the code (for now), it's free for use, anywhere, any time.

## Running/compiling
Why? I mean if you really want to, you will need to have a cross-compiler (gcc/binutils is what I use) 

Currently supporting i686-elf 

run `./compile.sh` (but don't forget to `chmod +x compile.sh`)

and then run `./run.sh` (but never forget `chmod +x run.sh`)
